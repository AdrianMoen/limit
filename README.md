Hi, simply fork or clone the repository and run with "python3 limit.py" (for ubuntu) or "python limit.py" (windows and such). 
To change rate of print for values, or maximum recursion, one must open the python.py file and change the numbers on line 28 and 32

Currently: N is amount of time in years, and value is amount of radioactive material in Kg. Please see limit.py for more information.
